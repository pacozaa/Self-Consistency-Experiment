        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Principles and Best Practices\n",
        "1. Accuracy and Relevance:\n",
        "   - Only include solutions and strategies that have been tested and proven effective.\n",
        "   - Clearly state any assumptions, limitations, or dependencies (e.g., specific Python libraries or solution hacks).\n",
        "   - For computational problems, encourage Python usage for more accurate calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Iterative Refinement:\n",
        "   - Continuously improve the cheatsheet by synthesizing both old and new solutions, refining explanations, and removing redundancies.\n",
        "   - Rather than deleting old content and writing new content each time, consider ways to maintain table content and synthesize information from multiple solutions.\n",
        "   - After solving a new problem, document any reusable codes, algorithms, strategies, edge cases, or optimization techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Clarity and Usability:\n",
        "   - Write concise, actioanble, well-structured entries.\n",
        "   - Focus on key insights or strategies that make solutions correct and effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Reusability:\n",
        "   - Provide clear solutions, pseudocodes, and meta strategies that are easily adaptable to different contexts.\n",
        "   - Avoid trivial content; focus on non-obvious, critical solution details and approaches.\n",
        "   - Make sure to add as many examples as you can in the cheatsheet.\n",
        "   - Any useful, efficient, generalizable, and illustrative solutions to the previous problems should be included in the cheatsheet.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. Solutions, Implementation Patterns, and Code Snippets:\n",
        "   - Document reusable code snippets, algorithms, and solution templates.\n",
        "   - Include descriptions, annotated examples, and potential pitfalls, albeit succinctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. [OPTIONAL] Edge Cases and Validation Traps:\n",
        "   - Catalog scenarios that commonly cause errors or unexpected behavior.\n",
        "   - Provide checks, validations, or alternative approaches to handle them.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. General Meta-Reasoning Strategies:\n",
        "   - Describe high-level problem-solving frameworks and heuristics (e.g., use Python to solve heuristic problems; in bipartite graphs, max matching = min vertex cover, etc.)\n",
        "   - Provide concrete yet succinct step-by-step guides for tackling complex problems.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Implement a Usage Counter\n",
        "   - Each entry must include a usage count: Increase the count every time a strategy is successfully used in problem-solving.\n",
        "   - Use the count to prioritize frequently used solutions over rarely applied ones.\n",
