       Each example/input/question is a Logic Grid Puzzle, also known as a Zebra Puzzle. In each puzzle, we are given N houses (numbered 1 to N from left to right) and M features for each house. There are N distinct values for each feature, and each house must have a unique value for each feature. Given a list of clues, one should be able to deduce a unique correct assignment of values. The logic grid puzzle is a typical Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) and is often used to test humans' logical reasoning abilities in exams such as the Law School Admission Test (LSAT).

      ## Reasoning steps:


      From Clue 1, we know that Eric is to the left of someone, so he must be
      the owner of House 1 because House 2 is the rightmost house.

      Additionally, we know that the person in House 2 must be Arnold, and he
      owns a Tesla Model 3. Thus, Eric owns a Ford F150.

      From Clue 2, we know that Eric keeps horses in House 1, which means the
      other house must keep cats. Finally, we arrive at the unique solution to
      this puzzle.

      The solution is presented in table format:
